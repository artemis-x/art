KeyPainter is a dynamic user interface creator, for Qt applications.
The KeyPainter creates simple compact panels, producing files of ".kpd" type. 
The question why to not use the existing Qt ui technology ?
The answer might be ... speed and size ... or just ... an other aproach.
For the history I had the need to do some special types of numeric keypads.
With the time this api progressed to a dynamic user interface.
Keypads are external files that are loading with any dialog or widget, without the need of Qt ui technology.
I share this technology in case it is useful to other too.
God Bless !
